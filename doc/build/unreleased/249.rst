    Mako 1.1 now supports Python versions:

    * 2.7
    * 3.4 and higher

    This includes that setup.py no longer includes any conditionals, allowing
    for a pure Python wheel build, however this is not necessarily part of the
    Pypi release process as of yet.  The test suite also raises for Python
    deprecation warnings.
